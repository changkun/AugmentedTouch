# MotionTouch - Potential Device Behaviour

This repository contains source code and all the research documentation for my implementation of touch with sensor data on mobile devices. 

I wish you can be inspired by this repository to keep interested in developing a new way to adapt user interface on mobile devices by using sensor behaviour and touch behaviour.

At the very beginining, you can see a very breif demo on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/voyEDZ6Awzw).

The project are inspired from some of touch behaviour research by [Daniel Buschek](http://www.medien.ifi.lmu.de/team/daniel.buschek/), and you can find the related works [here](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=TsVkUBwAAAAJ).

More information are coming soon...
