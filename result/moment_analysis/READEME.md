This folder contains:

* [**Error Rate result**](./error_rate) - Error rate in each classification condition and feature conditon
* [**ROC Curve**](./xy_feature) - Receiver operating characteristic curve in cross validation.

## Examples

### Error Rate

**Using XY feature**: ![roc-xy-img](./img/xy-thumb-user1.png)

**Using Offset feature**:![roc-offset-img](./img/offset-thumb-user1.png)

### ROC Curve
Receiver operating characteristic curve is a graphical plot that illustrates the performance of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied.

Here is a example result of Thumb classfication using attitute feature (roll, yaw, pitch):
